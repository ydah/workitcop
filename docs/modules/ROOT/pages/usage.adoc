= Usage

You need to tell RuboCop to load the Workitcop extension.
There are some ways to do this:

== RuboCop configuration file

Put this into your `.rubocop.yml`:

----
plugins: workitcop
----

or, if you are using several extensions:

----
plugins:
  - workitcop
  - rubocop-rspec
----

Now you can run `rubocop` and it will automatically load the Workitcop
cops together with the standard cops.

[source,bash]
----
$ rubocop --plugin workitcop
----

== Rake task

[source,ruby]
----
RuboCop::RakeTask.new do |task|
  task.plugins << 'workitcop'
end
----

NOTE: The plugin system is supported in RuboCop 1.72+. In earlier versions, use `require` instead of `plugins`.
